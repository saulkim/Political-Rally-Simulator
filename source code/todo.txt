improvement ideas
~code base~
1. remove duplicate code in buttonInteraction.cpp
-possible solution: create an object+method and pass in "Fl_Widget* obj, void* p" as parameter


~UI~
1. add "i repeat <message>" for repeated messages to explain to user why the same crowd can react differently despite same prompt?
-see if any users are confused first
